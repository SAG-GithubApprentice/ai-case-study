# Inflection, the company that created the chatbot, Pi (Personal Intelligence)

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company: The name of the company I chose for my case study is Inflection

* When was the company incorporated?: According to Forbes magazine, the company was founded in 2022 and is headquartered in Palo Alto, CA. (forbes)

* Who are the founders of the company?: According to Forbes, the founders of Inflection are Linkedin cofounder, Reid Hoffman and the cofounder of DeepMind, Mustafa Suleyman. Looking into Inflection’s profile in Wikipedia, another cofounder is mentioned, Karen Simonyan (forbes).

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?: Not much information is available for the inception of Inflection, but according to the company website, the company is structured as a “public benefit corporation.” This means the company not only operates to the sole benefit of its shareholders, but to all potential stakeholders to include the public (inflection).

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?: According to an article in Forbes magazine titled, “Inflection AI, The Year-Old Startup Behind Chatbot Pi, Raises $1.3 Billion” Inflection has raised $1.3 billion in total funding (forbes2). Big names mentioned in the article include Microsoft, Nvidia, Bill Gates and Eric Schmidt (former Google CEO). The article goes on to mention that Inflection is currently valued at $4 billion.

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?: In reading the header in Wikipedia, Inflection’s main delivered product is the chatbot called Pi. Pi stands for “personal intelligence” and is an AI-based personal assistant.

According to the Wikipedia article, 
	“Among the user experience goals that the company has stated for the Pi product are: providing an experience of emotional support for human users, in which the chatbot should be able to maintain an interactive text-based dialogue with a human user that includes elements of kindness, a diplomatic tone about sensitive topics, and humor.” (wikipedia) 

If I were to articulate a problem that Pi is trying to solve I would think that it is leveraging the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning to mimic sympathetic human conversation patterns to give the user a neutral outlet to bounce off ideas or problems. It is implied that a major problem in modern western society is people are disengaged with each other and lack healthy human interactions that are needed to maintain proper mental health baselines.

* Who is the company's intended customer?: Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? Being that Inflection’s Pi chatbot is designed to be a digital emotional companion, I would guess that the general public is the overall intended customer that Inflection is trying to target. Very little is stated publicly about how many users have either tried, or use Pi on a regular basis. 

If the major players in the tech world are funding Inception to the tune of billions, one could surmise that the Pi chatbot is actively being utilized on a significant basis.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?): The closest competitor to Pi chatbot is ChatGPT, another AI-based personal assistant chatbot that outputs information mimicking human thought processes. 

Where ChatGPT mimics an objective human assistant, Pi’s main algorithm is tweaked to mimic a slightly more subjective and empathetic point of view.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?: It's difficult to determine what types of algorithms Inflection is using to power Pi, I imagine these are closely guarded secrets and there is no single person even who works for Inflection who fully understands what they have.

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?: Inflection is a tech startup in the machine learning and artificial intelligence app and hardware development realm.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 10 years?: Inflection’s chatbot hasn’t been around as long as the major player, ChatGPT. The biggest innovations in these apps has been in the fine tuning of their ability to mimic the human thought process to output information in a manner that closely resembles how a person would engage with an audience.

* What are the other major companies in this field?: Some of the major players in the chatbot development field are IBM Watson, OpenAI ChatGPT and Google Bard. Microsoft is also a big player in the chatbot field, but their AI infrastructure is mostly tethered to OpenAI's ChatGPT.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?: Being that the founders and financiers of Inflection where/are major players in Google, Microsoft and OpenAI, the main trajectory of these AI companies will be more collaborative instead of competitive. I think Inflection’s sole deliverable product, Pi, is still in a semi-beta phase so it’s hard to gauge its current business impact.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?: According to Forbes, Inception raised $1.3 billion in funding and is currently valued at $4 billion. Based on the finance point of view, Inception has the esteem of its investors and sponsors. (forbes2)

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?: Numerous Reddit blogs of people who have tried Pi and ChatGPT have commented on how, “scarily good” Pi is at carrying on a conversation with the user. (reddit)

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!): If I understand what Pi is, it is a chatbot that mimics an empathetic neutral friend-like confidant. I wonder if Pi, in the future, can be utilized as a tool for mental therapy treatment. The main landing page for Pi already calls itself, “a coach, confidante, creative partner, sounding board and assistant.” (Inflection)

I wonder if Inflection could possibly lease out the algorithm for healthcare companies to integrate into their telehealth infrastructure. From there, they could have a feedback loop from their customers to offer functional improvements.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?: It’s highly speculated that the lack of interpersonal interaction among people in the modern western world is leading to an increase in depression and other mental illnesses. If Inflection can offer a way for people to practice interpersonal skills with a safe and neutral source, it might give them the confidence necessary to establish interpersonal relationships with real people. At the very least, Inflection’s chatbot can give people a way to bounce their thoughts with something that mimics human interaction in an interpersonal context.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?: This could be augmented within the framework of Inflection’s Pi algorithm. The more people utilize it, the more the algorithm can learn and better mimic the nuances of human interactions.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?: My solution is to improve upon the Pi chatbot through continuous beta testing and fine tuning the algorithm. A chatbot that can get as close to human interaction and mimic the personality of an empathetic and neutral listener can be used in a professional mental therapy context in the near future.
